# Airline Reservation System

The Airline Reservation System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate the core functionalities of an airline booking system. The project allows users to input their names, select flights, choose available seats, and generate a ticket with their reservation details. 

Key features include:
- Managing passenger information and flight schedules.

- Displaying available seats and handling seat reservations.

- Generating and displaying detailed ticket information for booked flights.

The project was developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach to ensure high reliability and code quality. Core components, such as the Passenger, Seat, Flight, and Ticket classes, were built and refined through unit tests, ensuring that each module works as expected before integrating them into the overall system.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, robust error handling, and database management, with a focus on scalability and maintainability through TDD.
## Class Descriptions
 - ***Passenger:*** This class represents a passenger in the system. It stores the passenger's name and potentially other relevant information like their booking history. The Passenger class allows for the management of individual customer data.

- ***Seat:*** This class represents a seat on a flight. It stores details like the seat number and its availability. This class helps track which seats are reserved and which are still open for booking.

- ***Flight:*** The Flight class models a flight, including its flight number, departure date, available seats, and any other flight-specific details. It handles tasks like displaying available seats and managing reservations for a specific flight.

- ***Database:*** The Database class acts as a central repository, storing and managing the application's data, including passengers, flights, seats, and tickets. It provides methods to add, retrieve, and manage this information, simulating the behavior of an actual database.
